# Data from SC19 Paper

Normalized Cross sections can be found [here](./cross-sections-normalized.csv). Data have been normalized to the lowest cross section for each vendor to prevent the leakage of business-sensitive data while allowing a direct comparison between codes and devices of the same vendor.

The codes used for radiation tests can be found [here](./codes). Radiation test procedures are described in the paper.
